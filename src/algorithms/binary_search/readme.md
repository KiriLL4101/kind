# Implement Binary Search

Searching is the method to search for a specific element in a group of an element. It needs a unique identity that is associated with the desired element. As a unique identity of that desired element has been found, the index to that desired element is returned.  The index indicates the location or address where that specific element has been found in the list elements of the array. If the desired data is found, particular data has been returned. Otherwise, it returned a null value.

A binary search algorithm is an approach for finding a position of a specified value within a sorted array. Binary search is the fastest and efficient searching technique used to find an element's position in a  linear array.
