# The Algorithm Challenge

[![Tests](https://github.com/KiriLL4101/the-algorithm-challenge/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KiriLL4101/the-algorithm-challenge/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

I started this repo using Typescript, I want like to practice Rust too. So let's practice the algorithms and data-structures using Typescript! (The exercises are from FreeCodeCamp)

## Process
I copy and paste the instructions from FreeCodeCamp, then I write the tests and finally I try to resolve the problem.

## Installation

### Common
Download the project locally.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KiriLL4101/the-algorithm-challenge.git
cd the-algorithm-challenge
```

### Typescript part
This project needs `node` and `npm`/`yarn`.
